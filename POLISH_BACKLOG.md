# Visual Polish Backlog

Running list of UI/UX polish items surfaced during the v1 refactor smoke tests.
These are intentionally deferred to a dedicated polish pass after the refactor
stages land, so the extraction work keeps momentum.

Each entry: one-line description + where it was surfaced + suggested approach.

### Streaming narration re-renders on completion

- **Surfaced:** Stage 1e-ii smoke test (2026-04-22).
- **Behavior:** Words appear several at a time during streaming (chunky), then
  the entire message visibly re-renders when the stream finishes.
- **Root cause:** `callAIGM()` removes the `#streamingNarration` div and then
  `processAIResponse` calls `addNarration()` to create a fresh entry with the
  fully-parsed text. Two DOM nodes, one swap.
- **Fix direction:** keep the streaming div in place and swap its innerHTML
  with the final parsed content, rather than removing + re-adding. Also
  investigate whether the "several words at a time" pacing is the SSE chunk
  size or the `updateStreamingNarration` debounce.
